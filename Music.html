            Wise men say
            Only fools rush in
            But I can't help falling in love with you
            Shall I stay?
            Would it be a sin
            If I can't help falling in love with you?

            Like a river flows
            Surely to the sea
            Darling, so it goes
            Some things are meant to be
            Take my hand,
            Take my whole life, too
            For I can't help falling in love with you
